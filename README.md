## Description ## 

This is a Simple theme developed based on "[Learn to Create WordPress Themes by building 5 projects](https://www.amazon.com/Create-WordPress-Themes-Building-Projects/dp/1787286649)" book -<br/>a Eduonix Learning Solutions guide on mastering the fundamentals of WordPress theme development and creating attractive WordPress themes from scratch.

I found myself into theme customization, using [elementor](https://elementor.com/) page builder, <br/>so [with an engineering perspective] I thought it would be best to learn this from scratch!
